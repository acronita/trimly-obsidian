# Changelog

## 0.1.0 — 2026-10-24

- 2026-10-24 — Initial release: dashboard with overview, transactions, accounts, budgets, recurring
  transactions and categories. All data stored in one AES-256-GCM encrypted file (`ledger.trimly`),
  key derived from a passphrase kept only on the device. Why: the vault is pushed to GitHub and the
  data is sensitive. Files touched: everything (new project).
- 2026-10-24 — Project tooling copied from Maguilanote: `.claude/` instructions and release skill,
  release workflow (now also runs `npm test`), lint config, auto-copy build into the vault via
  `.env.local`.
