# Changelog

## 0.1.0 — 2026-10-24

- 2026-10-25 — Release workflow runs on Node 22 instead of 20. Why: `npm test` uses
  `--experimental-strip-types`, which needs Node 22.6+, so the release build could not pass on 20.
  Files touched: `.github/workflows/release.yml`, `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md`.

- 2026-10-24 — Dashboard redesign: net worth hero with month income/expenses/saved, 6-month cash-flow
  chart, spending donut, upcoming recurring, transactions grouped by day, account and budget tiles,
  category icons with an icon picker, and a transaction modal with a type switch and large amount
  field. Money is formatted the way the currency expects (R$ 1.234,56 for BRL). Why: the first UI
  was a grid of identical grey boxes with no hierarchy. Files touched: `src/view.ts`, `src/charts.ts`,
  `src/modals.ts`, `src/ledger.ts`, `src/main.ts`, `src/styles/index.css`.

- 2026-10-24 — Initial release: dashboard with overview, transactions, accounts, budgets, recurring
  transactions and categories. All data stored in one AES-256-GCM encrypted file (`ledger.trimly`),
  key derived from a passphrase kept only on the device. Why: the vault is pushed to GitHub and the
  data is sensitive. Files touched: everything (new project).
- 2026-10-24 — Project tooling copied from Maguilanote: `.claude/` instructions and release skill,
  release workflow (now also runs `npm test`), lint config, auto-copy build into the vault via
  `.env.local`.
